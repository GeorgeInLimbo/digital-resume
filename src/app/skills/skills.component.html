        I recorded an EP with my high school rock band at a studio that used the mixing board they used to master the
        movie "Top Gun." We worked
        with
        the same producer that discovered Limp Bizkit. When I asked him about discovering Fred Durst he told me, "We
        all
        make mistakes,
        George."

        I've prepared hundreds of tax returns, including a Form 1040 for one of the lead performers in the highly
        acclaimed
        film,
        "Kindergarten Cop."

        I built a coffee table from Walnut and Maple using traditional joinery, and that table is currently
        furnishing
        the State Capital Building after it was seen displayed at a gallery for a makerspace I belong to called
        Tinkermill. There is now a water ring on that table.
