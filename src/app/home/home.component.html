        Thank you for visiting my Resume Web Application! This application was built with
        the to help
        showcase my abilities in web development.
    </p>
    <p>
        By browsing the application, and by following the link to its GitHub repository,
        you
        will find examples of several
        features used within the component-based framework that is Angular. This includes feature components,
        data-binding, use of
        Angular's routing module, pipes, services, and more.
        You'll see that I've included a reactive forms component, which includes examples of validations. Also, to
        demonstrate my knowledge of
        asynchronous
        programming I've also included a PokeDex application.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please take some time to browse my web application, review my job history, and to review the
        code itself by clicking the GitHub link. Your consideration is greatly appreciated and I hope to have the
        opportunity to speak
        with you about how I can continute to build on a strong foundation of technical knowledge and help
        contribute positively to your team's work culture. Any feedback that you are willing to provide will be
        gratefully received.
    </p>
